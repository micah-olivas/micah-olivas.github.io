I'm a Genetics PhD student studying enzyme evolution in [Polly Fordyce's lab](http://www.fordycelab.com) at Stanford University.

In my research, I use high-throughput microfluidics experiments to understand how amino acid sequence encodes enzyme function in both natural and model-designed proteins. Through this work, I hope to improve sequence-to-function prediction and provide insights into emerging foundation models for biology. I am grateful to be supported by an [F31 fellowship](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/bPF1kztkukeMtJJIhyTr_w/project-details/10752370) from the NIH.

**Research interests**:
- high-throughput assay development for kinetic measurements of proteins
- inferring catalytic properties from evolutionary sequence data
