I'm a Genetics PhD student studying enzyme evolution at Stanford University and am advised by [Polly Fordyce](http://www.fordycelab.com).

In my research, I use high-throughput microfluidics experiments to dissect how enzymatic properties are encoded in the amino acid sequences of both natural and model-designed proteins. Through this work, I hope to improve sequence-to-function prediction and provide insights into emerging sequence-based models. I am grateful to be supported by a [NRSA F31 fellowship](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/bPF1kztkukeMtJJIhyTr_w/project-details/10752370) from the National Human Genome Research Institute of the NIH.

**Research interests**
- high-throughput assay development for kinetic measurements of proteins
- inferring catalytic properties from evolutionary sequence data
