I'm a Genetics PhD student studying enzyme evolution at Stanford University. I am a member of [Polly Fordyce's group](http://www.fordycelab.com) in the Department of Genetics. I am grateful to be supported by a [NRSA F31 fellowship](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/bPF1kztkukeMtJJIhyTr_w/project-details/10752370) from the National Human Genome Research Institute of the NIH.

In my research, I use high-throughput microfluidics experiments to dissect how enzymatic properties are encoded in the amino acid sequences of both natural and model-designed proteins. Through this work, I hope to improve sequence-to-function prediction and provide insights into emerging sequence-based models.

**Research interests**
- High-throughput assay development for kinetic measurements of proteins
- Inferring catalytic properties from evolutionary sequence data
- Library generation methods for high-throughput experimental biophysics and biochemistry
