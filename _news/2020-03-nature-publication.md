New work on pooled CRISPR screens in an organoid model of lung cancer is out now in <a href="papers/2020_Nature.pdf">Nature</a>! We demonstrate that 3D "spheroid" cultures of lung adenocarcinoma resolve phenotypic defects that arise in 2D monoloayer cell culture and apply genome-wide forward screens in these models to identify genes implicated in tumor growth regulation.
